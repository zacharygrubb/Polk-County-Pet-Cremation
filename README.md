POLK COUNTY PET CREMATION

Hello, my name is Zachary Grubb.

This project is a website for a hypothetical pet cremation service using only html and css.

It contains links, responds to different screen sizes, and contains a basic form


USER STORIES

THANK YOU

In the future, I'd like to work on making more consistant commits; I did a lot more work on some than others. I also want to work on the general look and feel of websites, and thinking ahead next time on what it'll look like on a smaller screen size. Otherwise, I look forward to incorporating javascript and bootstrap into future websites!
